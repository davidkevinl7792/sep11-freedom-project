# Entry 1

In the pass 2 weeks, I decided to tinker with [firebase](firebase.com) since I want my game to save data and have people to log in. I'm going to make a game where you would get hints on where pets are and you would've had to track them. I was considering leaflet too, but it wouldn't save progress on and it would only display maps. It would help get a visual image on where the pets were saved, but it wouldn't save it

We are currently in the first step of our EDP (Engineering Design Process) where we are suppose to define our problem.
