# Entry 6
##### 6/13/23

Once we finished our project, we had to present in the expo elevator pitch where we pitched our website towards judges to get scored and see if we were good enough to be finalist. I took away that many people actually liked our website and we would always have a crowd around our computer, however I also saw flaws in our website like when it wouldn't display a error message when the password is too short and when you fill all the fields and press submit, it wouldn't save your data. It also wasn't as stressful as you think it would be since it seems like we were explaining our project to a friend. There was also a in class presentation where we presented in class and I took away that we should practice more before presenting because we got our lines mixed up and wasn't in sync when we were presenting. It takes a lot of collaboration to be able to get our lines synced up and not mixed. 

We are currently in the eighth step of our EDP (Engineering Design Process) where we present and communicate our results to other people. My next step would be getting feedback and going back to the fourth step of our EDP which was to create a plan for the feedback I've recieved.

The two skills I used was collaboration and communication. I used collaboration to collaborate with my partners to be able to create the script for the pitch. I also used communication to communicate to other people about our project and how it works.

Here's our slides and notes.
