# SEP11 Freedom Project
by David Liu

## Context
The "Freedom Project" for SEP11 is all about creating anything with javascript and to connect it to something you're passionate about. The purpose of this blog is to work on it during the entire school year to show off what we've learned and express our creativity.

## Content
For my project, I am making a pet finder website. This blog will walk through my process of independently studying Javascript and firebase in order to store data.

## Implications
The pet finder website has a huge beneficial for individual since it's a platform that helps individuals advocate for their lost pets. This would start relationship with others as there's a text box that can be used to connect people to help find the pet. This website could also save the environment since there's no longer a need of sticking paper on trees just to try to find a lost pet. This could also lead to people obtaining part time jobs if the advocator decides to add a reward if they find the pet. However this may be a negative impact on infrastructure as it remove the uses of walls of buildings and walls would have less of a function.
